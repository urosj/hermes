# Hermes

Hermes is a prototype notification aggregation system for the Juju charm store. 

## Why?
As a Juju user I would like to be notified about the availability of: 
- a new revision of a specific charm or bundle,
- any new charm or bundle from a specific user namespace,
- any charm or a bundle with some name,
- any bundle containing a charm,
- any charm that implements relation to another charm.

Note that the above list is not complete and that additional features will be implemented. 

## Notifications
Hermes will allow a Juju user to view all changes in the Juju charm store in one place and also select the mechanisms by which these changes will be delivered.
